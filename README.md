Project Summary: Data Analysis on Employee Records
In this project, I performed various data analysis tasks on employee records from an HR database. The goal was to derive insights on employee demographics, turnover rates, compensation, and employment status. Below is a breakdown of what was achieved:

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Identified and checked for duplicate records in the employee dataset.
Split employee names into first and last names, and updated the database accordingly.
2. Employee Demographics
Analyzed the total number of employees based on employment status (e.g., Active, Terminated).
Grouped employees by sex and department to better understand the gender and departmental distribution.
Analyzed employee marital status, citizenship, and race distribution across the workforce.
3. Employee Attrition Analysis
Conducted a deep dive into employee attrition, analyzing the number of employees who left the company by sex, position, and department.
Identified peak years of turnover to understand when the highest number of terminations occurred.
Calculated the number of years worked by terminated employees and compared it to the years worked by active employees.
4. Salary Analysis
Analyzed the total salary paid to active employees and categorized it by sex and department.
Calculated the average salary by position and department to understand compensation trends across the organization.
5. Employee Count by Department
Analyzed employee distribution across different departments.
Determined the total number of male and female employees in each department.
6. Manager and Department Overview
Investigated the distribution of managers across departments to understand managerial coverage.
7. Recruitment and Source Analysis
Analyzed the sources of recruitment for employees to understand where the company is attracting talent from.
8. Additional Insights
Gathered additional insights on the workforce by examining the total number of employees based on different marital statuses and identifying which citizenships are most represented in the workforce.
